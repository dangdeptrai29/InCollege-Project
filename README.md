# InCollege Project â€“ Week 5 Deliverable

## Description

This repository contains the **Week 5 deliverable** for the InCollege Project.  
The objective of this milestone is to complete the connection system by enabling users to **accept or reject pending connection requests** and **view their established network**.  
All inputs are read from file, all outputs are displayed on screen and duplicated into a file for validation.

---

## Key Features

### âœ… Manage Pending Connection Requests
- View all pending connection requests (from Week 4).  
- Accept or reject each request individually.
- Accepting a request:
  - Creates a permanent connection between the two users.
  - Removes that request from the pending list.
- Rejecting a request:
  - Simply removes it from the pending list.
- The user receives confirmation after each action.

### âœ… Display Established Network
- A new menu option `5. View My Network` shows all users currently connected to the logged-in user.
- Each connection displays at least the connected user's full name and may include their University and Major.

### âœ… File I/O Requirements
- **Input**: All inputs are read from `io/InCollege-Input.txt`.
- **Output**: All screen output is mirrored to `io/InCollege-Output.txt`.
- This ensures reproducible, automated testing.

## Tester Responsibilities

Testers are responsible for verifying every new feature end-to-end:

1. **Develop Test Cases**:
   - Accept single connection.
   - Reject single connection.
   - Mixed accept/reject scenario.
   - Network display after accepted requests.
   - Edge cases (no pending requests, multiple requests).

2. **Run Automated Tests**:
   Use the helper script to compile, seed test data, and run each case.

3. **Verify Outputs**:
   Compare program console vs. output files â€” they must be identical.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
Install GnuCOBOL on Linux/macOS/WSL:
```bash
sudo apt-get install open-cobol
# or
brew install gnu-cobol
```

Check version:
```bash
cobc -v
```

---

### Compile Program
```bash
cobc -x -free -o InCollegeTest src/InCollege.cob
```

---

### Run Program
```bash
./InCollegeTest
```

---

## Automated Testing (Recommended)

### Run All Epic 5 Test Cases

To automatically compile, seed data, and run every Epic 5 test case:

```bash
scripts/run_epic5_generate_outputs.sh
```

This will:
- Reset persistent data (`data/users.txt`, `data/requests.txt`, `data/connections.txt`).
- Automatically execute every file in `tests/epic5_inputs/`.
- Save corresponding results in `tests/epic5_outputs/`.

Each run prints confirmation lines like:
```
ðŸŸ© Generated: tests/epic5_outputs/TC01_accept_single.out.txt
```

---

### Manual Testing

To test individual cases:
```bash
cp tests/epic5_inputs/TC01_accept_single.txt io/InCollege-Input.txt
:> io/InCollege-Output.txt
./InCollegeTest
diff -u tests/epic5_expected/TC01_accept_single.out.txt io/InCollege-Output.txt
```

If thereâ€™s no difference, the test passes silently.
If thereâ€™s a mismatch, `diff` will print the differing lines.
