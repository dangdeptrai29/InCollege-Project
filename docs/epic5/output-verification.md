# Epic 5 Phase 1: Output Verification

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What We've Implemented
1. **GET-FULL-NAME** - Profile lookup helper (returns "First Last" or username)
2. **Enhanced VIEW-PENDING-REQUESTS** - Interactive with full name display
3. **ACCEPT-CONNECTION** - Updates status P → A with rollback
4. **REJECT-CONNECTION** - Removes connection with array shifting

### 🔍 Expected vs Actual Output

#### Test Scenario: User with Pending Requests

**Given**: 
- Connection in `data/connections.txt`: `testuser|mkim|P`
- Profile for testuser: `testuser|Test|User|—|—|—|||`
- User logs in as: `mkim`

**Expected Output** (if login worked correctly):
```
--- Pending Connection Requests ---
Connection request from Test User
1. Accept
2. Reject
[User enters 1]
Connection with Test User accepted
-----------------------------------
```

**Actual Behavior**:
- ⚠️ Pre-existing login bug: Always logs in as "TestUser" regardless of credentials
- ⚠️ Cannot fully test end-to-end due to this bug
- ✅ Code logic is correct (verified through code review)
- ✅ Code compiles without errors

---

## Code Correctness Verification

### Manual Code Review Results

#### 1. GET-FULL-NAME ✅
**Location**: lines 1131-1157

**Logic Check**:
```cobol
*> Loops through WS-PROFILES-TABLE
*> If username matches: builds "First Last", exits loop
*> If not found: uses username as fallback
```

**Verification**: ✅ CORRECT
- Proper loop with early exit
- Correct string concatenation with TRIM
- Fallback to username works
- No side effects

#### 2. VIEW-PENDING-REQUESTS Enhancement ✅
**Location**: lines 1075-1140

**Logic Check**:
```cobol
*> For each connection where receiver = current user AND status = 'P':
*>   1. Get sender's full name via GET-FULL-NAME
*>   2. Display "Connection request from [Full Name]"
*>   3. Display accept/reject options
*>   4. Read user choice
*>   5. Route to ACCEPT-CONNECTION or REJECT-CONNECTION
```

**Verification**: ✅ CORRECT
- Proper filtering: receiver = current user AND status = 'P'
- GET-FULL-NAME called with sender username
- Full name displayed in message
- Options displayed correctly
- Choice routing works (1→accept, 2→reject, other→skip)

#### 3. ACCEPT-CONNECTION ✅
**Location**: lines 1159-1211

**Logic Check**:
```cobol
*> 1. Validate status = 'P'
*> 2. Save original status
*> 3. Update to 'A'
*> 4. Save to file
*> 5. If error: rollback and notify
*> 6. If success: confirm with full name
```

**Verification**: ✅ CORRECT
- Status validation present
- Rollback mechanism implemented correctly
- File error checking works
- Confirmation message uses WS-DISPLAY-NAME (already populated)

#### 4. REJECT-CONNECTION ✅
**Location**: lines 1213-1268

**Logic Check**:
```cobol
*> 1. Validate status = 'P' AND receiver = current user
*> 2. Shift array: move elements [J+1] to [J] for J from I to COUNT-1
*> 3. Decrement count
*> 4. Save to file
*> 5. If error: notify (rollback impractical)
*> 6. If success: confirm with full name
```

**Verification**: ✅ CORRECT
- Dual validation (status + receiver)
- Array shifting loop correct: J from WS-I, moves [J+1] to [J]
- Boundary check: J < WS-CONNECTIONS-COUNT
- Count decrement correct
- Confirmation message uses WS-DISPLAY-NAME (already populated)

## What Would Happen in Production (if login worked)

### Scenario 1: Accept Connection

**Input**:
```
1                    # Log In
mkim                 # Username
